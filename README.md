# accumulation_network_circular_economy
The code in this repository allows to analyse Circular Economy with a Linear Network Flow Dynamics approach. Since CE is strongly related to reuse, share, repaire and recycle materials, this may lead to the accumulation of some unwanted compounds that on the long run may harm human health or the environment. A specific code is developped for checking whether this accumulation occur and check if it is robust with a Monte Carlo approach.
